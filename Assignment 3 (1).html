<h1>Traveling in Depression</h1>
<p>
  When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.
</p>

  <p>At five, I <a href=" https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Empire_State_Building ">marveled</a> at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge<p><a href="/day 3.html "><img src="fine.png" style="width:200px;hight:400px; float:left;margin: 20px;"></a></p> and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in

  It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first
language became interested in language.
</p>
<p>
  It began with French, which taught me the importance of

pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris

where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it
PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on<
the A, she looked at me bewildered.

<p>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and
aware of its similarities with English through cognates.
Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks
different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to
me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates
come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. <a href = "https:// koikoijohnson@gmail.com ">Send Us Email</a>
<p>In this college, i developed an enthusiastic fo Chinese as i  studied Chinese at my

school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is los.
<p>
  oved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning

fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means

volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty
and rhythm as I form them.
